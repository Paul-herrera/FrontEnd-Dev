/*
    Q3 - What CSS property are you having the most trouble figuring out?
*/

I had trouble with flexbox and more recently CSS grid but after some practice and the use of google I think its fairly manageable.

/*
    Q4 - What is the best CSS property and why?
*/

(I hope this is just opinion based)
I would say the best property is "display" due to its power. It can make elements function as "inline" or "block" regardless of their inherent display properties.
Display sets up the ability to use "table", flex", and "grid" functions. Finally, display even removes all other properties via "initial".
